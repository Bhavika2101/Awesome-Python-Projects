"""
1. Test when the object is initially out of canvas bound on the left side: This could be done by providing a negative coordinate value for the object's initial position on the horizontal axis. The expected outcome is that the object would adjust its position to be at the left boundary. 

2. Test when the object is initially out of canvas bound on the right side: Provide a value for the object's initial position on the horizontal axis that is more than the canvas width. The expected outcome is that the object would not move further than the right boundary.

3. Test when the object is initially in a position within the canvas boundaries: Provide value for the object's initial position on the horizontal axis that is less than the canvas width but more than zero. The object should be able to move freely as long as it hasn't reached the canvas boundaries.

4. Test when the object is moving to the left and reaches the left boundary: This involves manipulating the 'self.x' variable so that 'pos[0] + self.x' equals zero. Verify if the x-coordinate of the object is not less than zero after moving.

5. Test when the object is moving to the right and reaches the right boundary: This involves manipulating the 'self.x' variable so that 'pos[2] + self.x' equals the canvas width. Verify if the x-coordinate of the object is not more than the canvas width after moving.

6. Test when the object is initially at the left boundary and wants to move left: If the object attempts to move further left while at the left boundary, the object's position should remain the same.

7. Test when the object is initially at the right boundary and wants to move right: If the object attempts to move further right while at the right boundary, the object's position should remain the same.
