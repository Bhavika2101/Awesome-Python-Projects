================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Unspecific Imports (CWE-1004)
Issue: The code is using wildcard (*) imports from the tkinter library. This can make the code more challenging to read and debug, and might result in naming conflicts, which could lead to overwriting objects or use of unintended objects.
Solution: Replace wildcard imports with explicit imports, or import the whole module and use a variable prefix to access the functions.

Vulnerability: Unused Imports (CWE-1161)
Issue: The code imports modules 'time' and 'random' that are not used in the provided code snippet. Unused imports can lead to unnecessary memory usage and potential security risks if the imported libraries have vulnerabilities.
Solution: Remove unused imports to improve performance and reduce the attack surface.

Vulnerability: Insecure Object References (CWE-610)
Issue: In the 'turn_right' function, 'self.x' is directly exposed to external input ('event'), which the function assigns to a hard-coded value. It may introduce issues with object references if not carefully handled.
Solution: Ensure that appropriate access control checks are in place, and validation strategies are managed to prevent unauthorized access to object references.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Verify if the turn_right method changes the paddle's x value
Details:
  TestName: test_turn_right_updates_value
  Description: The test will verify if the turn_right method actually changes the x attribute of the paddle to 3.5.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a Paddle object with a specified x value.
  Act: Invoke the turn_right method on the created Paddle object.
  Assert: Check if the x attribute of the Paddle object is 3.5 after invoking the turn_right method.
Validation:
  If the test passes, it confirms that the turn_right method indeed updates the x value of the paddle object. This is crucial as it is representative of a movement to the right in the game and missing or incorrect implementation may lead to unexpected gameplay behavior.

Scenario 2: Verify if the turn_right method only affects the paddle's x value 
Details:
  TestName: test_turn_right_only_affects_x
  Description: The test will check if invoking the turn_right method only changes the x attribute of the paddle while keeping all other attributes unchanged. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a Paddle object with specified attributes.
  Act: Invoke the turn_right method on the created Paddle object.
  Assert: Compare all the attributes of the Paddle object before and after the invoking of turn_right method to ensure only x has changed.
Validation:
  Ensuring that the turn_right method does not affect any attribute apart from x is vital in maintaining the correct state of the game. If the method modifies other attributes unintentionally, it may result in incorrect game behavior.

Scenario 3: Validate the turn_right method when the paddle is stationary 
Details:
  TestName: test_turn_right_when_stationary
  Description: The test will check the behavior of the turn_right method when the game paddle is stationary or not in motion.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a Paddle object with predefined attributes representing a stationary paddle.
  Act: Invoke the turn_right method on the created Paddle object.
  Assert: Check if the x value has been updated to 3.5 indicating a movement towards the right.
Validation:
  This test ensures that a paddle which is stationary or at rest can still be directed towards the right through the use of the turn_right method. Validating this scenario ensures the integrity of gameplay under all conditions.
