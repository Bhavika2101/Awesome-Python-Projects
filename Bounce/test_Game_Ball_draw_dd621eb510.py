"""
1. Scenario: When the ball hits a brick
    - Expected Result: "self.y" becomes the first element in shuffled "start" list and "self.brick_hit(pos)" should be triggered.

2. Scenario: When the ball's Y position is less or equal to 0
    - Expected Result: "self.y" becomes the first element in shuffled "start" list.

3. Scenario: When the ball's Y position is greater or equal to canvas height
    - Expected Result: "self.bottom_hit" is set to True.

4. Scenario: When the ball's X position is less or equal to 0
    - Expected Result: "self.x" becomes the first element in shuffled "start" list.

5. Scenario: When the ball's X position is greater or equal to canvas width
    - Expected Result: "self.x" becomes -first element in shuffled "start" list.

6. Scenario: When the ball hit the paddle
    - Expected Result: "self.y" becomes -first element in shuffled "start" list.

7. Scenario: Check random movement of the ball
    - Expected Result: Ball's X and Y coordinates should get updated as per the above conditions meeting their criteria.

8. Scenario: When the ball movement is continuous and doesn't hit any bricks, paddle, or wall
    - Expected Result: Ball should continue to move according to its previous X, Y coordinates.

9. Scenario: When the canvas coordinates are not retrievable
    - Expected Result: Check the behavior of the game, as this will be a situation not handled in the method.

10. Scenario: When the ball hits multiple bricks continuously
    - Expected Result: Confirm that "self.y" value updates successfully for every hit and "self.brick_hit(pos)" is triggered for each brick.

11. Scenario: When the ball is hitting the paddle continuously 
    - Expected Result: "self.y" value becomes -first element in shuffled "start", providing continuous rebounding motion off the paddle.

12. Scenario: When the ball hits the bottom edge continuously
    - Expected Result: "self.bottom_hit" remains True and the ball's bounce behavior depending on the game rules.

13. Scenario: Check the ball bounce behavior when it hits the corner where two walls meet 
    - Expected Result: The ball should rebound back at an appropriate angle as per the game rules.
