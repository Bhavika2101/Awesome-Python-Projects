"""
1. Scenario: Check if the object is properly initialized by the `__init__` function
    - Given a `canvas` object and `color` as inputs
    - When we create a new `game_Bricks` object
    - Then the `canvas` and `id` attributes of the new object should be properly populated

2. Scenario: Check if color input changes the color of the brick
    - Given a color input as 'red' 
    - When we create a `game_Bricks` object
    - Then the `canvas.create_oval` method should be called with the correct `fill` argument as 'red'

3. Scenario: Check if the dimensions of the oval are fixed
    - Given a `canvas` object and `color`
    - When we create a `game_Bricks` object
    - Then the `canvas.create_oval` method should be called with fixed dimensions (5, 5, 25, 25)

4. Scenario: Check if the width of the oval is fixed
    - Given a `canvas` object and `color`
    - When we create a `game_Bricks` object
    - Then the `canvas.create_oval` method should be called with fixed width 2
  
5. Scenario: Check if color input is an empty string
    - Given an empty string as color
    - When we create a new `game_Bricks` object
    - Then it should use the default color

6. Scenario: Check input of `canvas` when it is `None`
    - Given `None` as `canvas`
    - When we create a new `game_Bricks` object
    - Then it should raise an appropriate error

Please note that these are hypothetical scenarios based on the provided function which seems to be a class constructor for a game item. The actual scenarios might differ in real usage.
