"""
Scenario 1: Test with an empty canvas
- Description: In this scenario, initialize the game_Bricks function with an empty canvas to see how it behaves in such an instance.

Scenario 2: Test with a null color
- Description: While initializing the game_Bricks function, provide null as the color argument to check how the function responds.

Scenario 3: Test with an undefined color
- Description: This test scenario involves initializing the game_Bricks function with a color that's not defined within the function or the program it is from.

Scenario 4: Test with multiple canvases
- Description: Create a test where the game_Bricks function is initialized with multiple canvases.

Scenario 5: Test with differing canvas and color combinations
- Description: In this test, various combinations of canvas and color inputs are tested to ensure that the function consistently behaves in the expected manner. 

Scenario 6: Test the return of the 'id' attribute
- Description: This test scenario involves validating that the 'id' attribute of the function returns expected values when passed a specific canvas and color. 

Scenario 7: Test with a canvas that exceeds the specified dimensions
- Description: This checks if an error occurs when the dimensions of the canvas exceed those specified in the game_Bricks function.

Scenario 8: Test with a negative-sized canvas
- Description: Check what happens when the dimensions of the canvas are negative. This test scenario is designed to test edge cases. 

Scenario 9: Test with a color that contains alphanumeric characters
- Description: Test if the color attribute accepts color values that include alphanumeric characters.

Scenario 10: Test with a canvas and a color that contains special characters
- Description: Check how the function handles a canvas and a color that contain special characters.

Scenario 11: Testing with a color in RGB format
- Description: Test how the function handles the input of a color in RGB format. 

Scenario 12: Test with a canvas that contains transparent areas
- Description: This will test how the function handles transparency in the canvas.
