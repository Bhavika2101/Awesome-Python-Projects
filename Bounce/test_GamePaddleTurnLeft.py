================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Unvalidated User Input
Issue: The `turn_left` function takes an event as input but doesn't validate it, leaving the application vulnerable to malicious input.
Solution: Always validate and sanitize user input to avoid potential security risks. In this case, check that the event parameter passed into the `turn_left` function is valid.

Vulnerability: Insecure Use of Random Function
Issue: Random function from the 'random' package is used which is not cryptographically secure. It can be predictable and allows attackers guessed attacks.
Solution: Use 'secrets' library which is designed to be cryptographically secure, or use 'random.SystemRandom' class for generating secure random numbers.

Vulnerability: Non-unique tkinter identifiers
Issue: Usage of tkinter library could result in non unique identifiers on the frontend, opening up the possibility for various attacks including but not limited to replay attacks.
Solution: Ensure the usage of unique identifiers when dealing with tkinter library. Consider using uuid library to generate unique ids.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Verify function sets paddle's horizontal movement to left
Details:
  TestName: test_paddle_turn_left
  Description: The test is intended to verify if calling the 'turn_left' function will set the paddle's x-coordinate to -3.5 representing moving paddle to the left.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an object for the Paddle and capture its original x-coordinate.
  Act: Invoke the 'turn_left' function with the necessary event input.
  Assert: The x-coordinate of the Paddle after the function call should be -3.5.
Validation:
  It's essential to validate that the paddle's x direction is set correctly for the game to progress as expected. The change in game.Paddle's x direction represents the movement and is crucial for game logic.

Scenario 2: Validate function 'turn_left' can be called multiple times
Details:
  TestName: test_paddle_turn_left_multiple_calls
  Description: This test is designed to verify that the function 'turn_left' does not error out or change behaviour even when called multiple times in a row.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an object for the Paddle and capture its original x-coordinate.
  Act: Invoke the 'turn_left' function multiple times in succession.
  Assert: Every time when 'turn_left' should set the paddle's x-coordinate to -3.5 regardless of its previous position.
Validation:
  To mimic the real-time scenario of a paddle being commanded to turn left continuously, this test validates whether or not the function can handle these continuous commands. As the paddle should obey the current command irrespective of previous ones, the x-coordinate should always reset to -3.5.

Scenario 3: Test for the effect of calling 'turn_left' on the game.Paddle object with a different initial x-value 
Details:
  TestName: test_paddle_turn_left_different_initial_x
  Description: This test intends to check that irrespective of the initial x-coordinate of the Paddle, calling 'turn_left' changes the x-coordinate to -3.5.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an object for the Paddle with a random x-coordinate other than -3.5.
  Act: Invoke the 'turn_left' function.
  Assert: The x-coordinate of the Paddle after function call should change to -3.5.
Validation:
  The function's purpose is to enforce the paddle's x-coordinate to be -3.5, and not a function of its initial state. As such, this test is important to ensure consistent behavior of the function across different initial states of the Paddle object.
