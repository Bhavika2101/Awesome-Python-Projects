"""
1. Test the `start_game` function when the game is not initially playing. The function should start the game from the beginning, resetting the score, clearing the canvas, and initializing game elements like Ball, Paddle, and Bricks.

2. Test the `start_game` function when the game is initially playing. The function should be ignored and the game should continue as normal.

3. Test the working of the paddle and ball, their movement and interaction with each other and with the bricks when the game starts

4. Check whether the score is properly reset to 'Score: 00' at the beginning of the game.

5. Verify if the canvas is correctly cleared at the beginning of each game.

6. Validate that the bricks are correctly initialized and placed on the board at the beginning of each game.

7. Test if the game behaves correctly when the ball does not hit the bottom. The game should proceed as normal.

8. Test if the game responds as expected when the ball hits the bottom. The game should end, display "GAME OVER!!", and set `playing` to `False`.

9. Confirm that the ball changes color as defined in the `BALL_COLOR` array and that it is random for each new game.

10. Test if the game correctly detects when a player has won (when `ball.hit` equals 95). If a win is detected, the game should display "YOU WON!!", set `playing` to `False`, and stop updating the game.

11. Validate that the game is paused when `paddle.pausec` equals 1. During pause, the game should display "PAUSE!!" and keep updating the game without proceeding further in the game.

12. Validate that if the game is paused and then resumed, it continues correctly from where it was paused.

13. Test that the delay (sleep time) after each game update is correctly set. This makes the game playable by slowing down the frame update rate.

14. Check the behavior when `root.update_idletasks()`, `root.update()` fails or throws an exception. The game should handle these failures gracefully.
