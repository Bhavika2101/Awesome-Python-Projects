"""
Test Scenario 1:
If playing is initially False, check that the game starts as expected.
- "Score: 00" is displayed
- The canvas is cleared
- A paddle is created
- Bricks are created and arranged properly
- A ball is created
- game_start_game sets playing to True

Test Scenario 2:
If playing is initially True, check that the function does not carry out any operations.

Test Scenario 3:
Check that the ball and paddle are drawn as expected during the game loop until the ball hits the bottom.

Test Scenario 4:
Validate that the game ends and displays "GAME OVER!!" when the ball hits the bottom.

Test Scenario 5:
Validate that the game pauses correctly when paddle.pausec is set to 1, and displays the "PAUSE!!" message.

Test Scenario 6:
When the game resumes after a pause, validate that objects are drawn correctly and the game continues as expected.

Test Scenario 7:
If ball.hit equals 95, validate that the game ends and "YOU WON !!" message is displayed.

Test Scenario 8:
Check if the colors of the ball and bricks are chosen randomly from their respective color lists. 

Test Scenario 9:
Validate that the game loops continuously until the ball hits the bottom or ball.hit equals 95.

Test Scenario 10:
Validate that the game doesn't start if the global variable "playing" is set to True. 

Test Scenario 11:
Check that no error is thrown if the game is attempted to be reset in the middle of a game. 

Test Scenario 12:
Check that the game ends correctly and doesn't result in an infinite loop.

Test Scenario 13:
Check that the sleep functions are working correctly and providing the expected delay.
