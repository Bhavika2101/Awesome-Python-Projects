================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Bare Except: CWE-397
Issue: Bare exceptions can catch unexpected errors, making it harder to debug. This practice also makes the program prone to continue operating after critical errors.
Solution: Replace bare 'except:' with 'except Exception:' and only catch exceptions you can handle. Also, consider logging errors for easier troubleshooting.

Vulnerability: Improper Error Handling: CWE-223
Issue: The error caught in 'try-except' block is not handled which can lead to unexpected results and program crashes.
Solution: Ensure all caught exceptions are properly handled or logged correctly. In this case, consider logging or printing the exception message for better debugging.

Vulnerability: CWE-346: Origin Validation Error
Issue: The tkinter library has vulnerability: GUI event functions can be triggered by synthetic events from malicious sources.
Solution: Use the .trusted event attribute to verify event origins. Apart from this, ensure you are using the latest version of tkinter library.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validate successful brick hit when ball hits the brick
Details:
  TestName: test_brick_hit_successful
  Description: This test will verify whether the brick hit functionality works correctly by checking whether the hit_counter is incremented, the brick is deleted, and the score is updated appropriately when a brick is hit by the ball.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a Ball object in the game with given coordinates, and add a brick at the same or overlapping coordinates.
  Act: Invoke the brick_hit function on the Ball object.
  Assert: Check if the brick is removed from the game canvas, and the Hit counter and Score in the game status are appropriately updated.
Validation:
  Rationale: This is an important test as it verifies the main business logic of the brick breaking game i.e., to successfully break the bricks when hit by the ball and appropriately update the hit counter and score.

Scenario 2: Validate when no brick is hit by the ball
Details:
  TestName: test_brick_hit_failure
  Description: This test will verify that the system correctly handles the case when no brick is hit. The Hit counter and score should remain the same and no bricks should be removed from the game canvas.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a Ball object in the game, and ensure that the Ball's coordinates do not overlap with any brick's coordinates.
  Act: Invoke the brick_hit function on the Ball object.
  Assert: Verify that no bricks are removed from the game canvas, and the Hit counter and score remain the same.
Validation:
  Rationale: This test ensures that the game behaves correctly when the ball moves without hitting any bricks, i.e., no bricks are incorrectly assumed as hit, and no unnecessary score or hit counter updates take place. 

Scenario 3: Multiple brick hits at one time
Details:
  TestName: test_multiple_brick_hits
  Description: This test is to verify that when a ball hits multiple bricks at the same instance, all the hit bricks are removed and the score and hit counter are updated accordingly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a Ball object with coordinates that overlap with multiple bricks.
  Act: Invoke the brick_hit function on the Ball object.
  Assert: Verify that all the hit bricks are removed from the game canvas, and the hit counter and score are updated correctly.
Validation:
  Rationale: In certain cases, multiple bricks might be hit simultaneously (especially in levels with multiple balls or power-ups). This test ensures that the game correctly handles such situations.

Scenario 4: Ensure undeterred game progress in case of exceptions
Details:
  TestName: test_exception_handling
  Description: This test is to validate that the game continues to function as expected even when an exception is encountered during a brick hit event.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a Ball object and bricks in such a way that an exception is triggered when brick_hit is invoked (such as an index error due to out-of-bounds brick coordinate).
  Act: Invoke the brick_hit function on the Ball object.
  Assert: Verify that despite the exception, the game continues to function correctly, i.e., the hit counter, score and game canvas are updated appropriately as per other game rules.
Validation:
  Rationale: Robustness of the game is verified by this test. It ensures that the game can handle all sorts of scenarios and unexpected events without breaking or halting.
