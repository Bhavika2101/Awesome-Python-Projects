"""
1. Scenario: Test when the turn_left function is called. 
    - Given that the game is in progress and turn_left is called,
    - When this function is executed, 
    - Then the self.x value should be updated to -3.5. 

2. Scenario: Test for turning left when self.x is at 0
    - Given that self.x is currently at 0,
    - When the turn_left function is called,
    - Then self.x should have the value -3.5.

3. Scenario: Test for turning left when self.x is of positive value
    - Given that self.x is currently a positive number,
    - When the turn_left function is called,
    - Then self.x should have the value -3.5 regardless of the previous value.

4. Scenario: Test for turning left when self.x is already at -3.5
    - Given that self.x is currently at -3.5,
    - When the turn_left function is called,
    - Then self.x should remain at -3.5

5. Scenario: Test for turning left in rapid succession
    - Given that the game is in progress, 
    - When the turn_left function is called in rapid succession,
    - Then self.x should consistently remain at -3.5, proving that multiple calls do not affect the consistency of the function.

6. Scenario: Test for game's overall functionality after turning left
    - Given that the game is in progress and the game's functionality depends on self.x value,
    - When the turn_left function is called, 
    - Then the game's behavior should change in a manner consistent with self.x being -3.5. 

7. Scenario: Test for turn_left with various "Event" inputs
    - Given various "Event" inputs,
    - When turn_left function is called,
    - Then the self.x should be updated to -3.5 regardless of Event input.

These scenarios help to ensure that `turn_left` function is consistently setting the value of self.x to -3.5 as expected and the game behavior changes accordingly.
