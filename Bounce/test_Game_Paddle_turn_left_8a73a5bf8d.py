================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (CWE-639)
Issue: Any user could modify the 'self.x' variable in the 'turn_left' function, potentially causing unpredictable behavior in your application.
Solution: Ensure appropriate access control measures are in place, such as encapsulating 'self.x' within a class and changing its value via class methods only.

Vulnerability: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function (CWE-676)
Issue: The use of 'random' function may lead to the generation of predictable values which can be exploited by an attacker.
Solution: Consider using 'secrets' library which generates cryptographically strong random numbers suitable for managing data such as passwords, account authentication. Python's 'random' is not suitable for security/cryptographic purposes.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validate if Paddle's x-coordinate is correctly updated
Details:
  TestName: test_paddle_turn_left
  Description: This test is intended to verify that calling the turn_left method updates the x-coordinate of the Paddle object to -3.5. The business logic validates the operation of an important game feature – movement of the paddle.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Paddle object with arbitrary initial x-coordinate. 
  Act: Invoke the turn_left method on the Paddle instance.
  Assert: Check if the x-coordinate of the Paddle object is updated to -3.5.
Validation: 
  This test checks that the Paddle's x-coordinate is correctly updated when turning left. This is important as it is fundamental to the execution of the player’s control in the game, ensuring the paddle moves as expected.

Scenario 2: Validate multiple calls to Paddle's turn_left do not change the outcome
Details:
  TestName: test_multiple_turn_left_calls
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the state of the x-coordinate of the Paddle object remains at -3.5 even after multiple turn_left calls. This scenario tests whether the functionality is idempotent or not.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Paddle object with arbitrary x-coordinate.
  Act: Invoke the turn_left method on the Paddle’s instance multiple times.
  Assert: Check if the x-coordinate of the Paddle object remains at -3.5.
Validation: 
  This test checks that repeated left turns do not cause any changes. This underlines the stable and consistent behavior of the game controls, ensuring that multiple clicks or key presses do not result in unintended motion of the paddle.

Scenario 3: Confirm that turn_left function doesn't affect other properties of the Paddle object
Details:
  TestName: test_turn_left_isolated_effect
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the execution of turn_left only affects the x-coordinate of the Paddle object and has no influence on its other properties.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the Paddle object and store its initial state (properties).
  Act: Invoke the turn_left method on the Paddle’s instance.
  Assert: Compare the original state of the Paddle instance (except x-coordinate) with its state after executing turn_left.
Validation: 
  This test ensures that the turn_left method demonstrates encapsulated behavior, only influencing the x-coordinate. This is critical as it ensures the independence and segregation of the object's attributes, guaranteeing a coherent state management of the game objects.
