================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure use of random module
Issue: The Random library is not recommended for generating security-sensitive information as it uses a deterministic seed to generate numbers, hence it's predictable.
Solution: For security-sensitive applications, consider using a more secure random generator such as secrets module provided by python 3.6 and above. E.g. secrets.randbelow(10) to generate a random number between 0-9

Vulnerability: Uncontrolled use of Tkinter
Issue: Tkinter, Python's standard GUI Library, when used in an uncontrolled manner, can cause security risks. If not properly managed, it can enable user interactions that should be prevented.
Solution: Ensure you regulate which events should react to user interaction. Never allow the execution of untrustworthy codes via your user interface. Implement proper error handling and input validation to prevent code injection through the UI.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Checking value assignment when method is invoked
Details:
    TestName: test_value_assignment_on_turn_left
    Description: This test scenario is designed to verify that when the function 'turn_left' is invoked, the attribute 'x' is always set to -3.5.
Execution:
    Arrange: An instance of class 'Paddle' is created.
    Act: The 'turn_left' function of the Paddle instance is invoked.
    Assert: Check that 'x' attribute of Paddle instance is equal to -3.5.
Validation:
    This is a critical test scenario as it validates that the 'turn_left' function behaves according to its design. It sets the direction of the paddle in the game accordingly.

Scenario 2: Testing turn_left, when x is already -3.5
Details:
    TestName: test_turn_left_when_x_already_negative
    Description: This test scenario verifies if the 'turn_left' method gets invoked, when 'x' is already at -3.5.
Execution:
    Arrange: An instance of class 'Paddle' is created and 'x' is set to -3.5.
    Act: 'turn_left' function of the Paddle instance is invoked.
    Assert: Check that 'x' of Paddle instance stays at -3.5.
Validation:
    Since the function must always set 'x' to -3.5 when called, it should not alter 'x's value if it is already set to -3.5. This is relevant as turn_left getting invoked multiple times consecutively is a very possible user scenario in a game.

Scenario 3: Verifying the value of 'x' when 'turn_left' is invoked multiple times consecutively
Details:
    TestName: test_consecutive_turn_left_calls
    Description: This test scenario is designed to verify that if 'turn_left' method gets invoked multiple times consecutively, 'x' remains at -3.5.
Execution:
    Arrange: An instance of class 'Paddle' is created.
    Act: The 'turn_left' function of the Paddle instance is invoked multiple times.
    Assert: Confirm whether the value of 'x' remains at -3.5 after every call.
Validation:
    This test scenario ensures that the 'turn_left' function works as expected even when it's invoked multiple times in succession. This scenario is important because in a game setting, players may attempt to move the paddle to the left multiple times in quick succession.
