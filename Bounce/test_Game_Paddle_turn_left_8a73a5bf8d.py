"""
1. Scenario: Paddle is currently stationary
   - Given: The game has been initialized and the paddle is stationary (i.e. x = 0)
   - When: The user triggers the 'turn_left' event
   - Then: The paddle's x velocity should be set to -3.5

2. Scenario: Paddle is moving rightward
   - Given: The game has been initialized and the paddle is moving rightward (i.e. x > 0)
   - When: The user triggers the 'turn_left' event
   - Then: The paddle's x velocity should turn negative i.e. be set to -3.5

3. Scenario: Paddle is already moving leftward
   - Given: The game has been initialized and the paddle is moving leftward (i.e. x < 0)
   - When: The user triggers the 'turn_left' event again
   - Then: The paddle's x velocity should stay at -3.5, i.e. there should have been no change from the previous condition

4. Scenario: Paddle is at the left boundary of the game screen
   - Given: The game has been initialized and the paddle is at the leftmost boundary (i.e., its minimum x boundary)
   - When: The user triggers the 'turn_left' event
   - Then: The paddle's x velocity should be set to -3.5, but it should not move further left beyond the boundary, if boundary conditions are applied.

5. Scenario: The turn_left event is triggered multiple times
   - Given: The game has been initialized
   - When: The user quickly triggers multiple 'turn_left' events
   - Then: The paddle's x velocity should be -3.5 regardless of the number of times the event has been triggered.

6. Scenario: Paddle's original x velocity has a decimal unit
   - Given: The game has been initialized and the paddle's x velocity is a non-zero decimal
   - When: The user triggers the 'turn_left' event
   - Then: The paddle's x velocity should be set to -3.5, regardless of its prior value.
