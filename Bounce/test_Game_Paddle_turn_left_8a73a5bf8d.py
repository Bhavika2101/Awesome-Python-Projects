"""
Scenario 1: Initial State
- We start with an initial state, likely with the Paddle in a neutral or rightward position.
- We apply the turn_left method.
- We check whether the value of self.x is now -3.5, indicating a leftward turn.

Scenario 2: Turning left multiple times
- We start with the Paddle in a neutral position.
- We apply the turn_left method several times in a row.
- We check whether the Paddle's position does not go beyond -3.5, it should always be -3.5 irrespective of the number of times the method is called.

Scenario 3: Switching from right turn
- We start with the Paddle turning or positioned to the right (presumably with a positive self.x value).
- We apply the turn_left method.
- We confirm that the Paddle now has a self.x value of -3.5, reflecting a left turn.

Scenario 4: Effect on other variables
- We begin with the Paddle in any position along with various initialized variables related to the Paddle's status.
- We trigger the turn_left method.
- We verify whether the function's operation only modifies the self.x value and not any other attributes of the Paddle.

Scenario 5: Effect with other external factors
- We start with a Paddle that can be influenced by external factors (like wind, velocity etc.).
- We apply the turn_left method.
- We then check whether the Paddle's turn left effect maintains the self.x value to -3.5 regardless of any external factors existence. 

Scenario 6: Simultaneous Turns
- We start with a Paddle in a neutral or rightward position.
- We apply the turn_left method concurrently with a right turn method.
- We verify that the value of self.x is indeed -3.5 and not some intermediary or unexpected value, indicating that the left turn has taken precedence or properly queued.
