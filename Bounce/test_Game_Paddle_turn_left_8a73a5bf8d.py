================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Use of Tkinter Library
Issue: The wildcard import method from tkinter is not regarded as a best practice. It could potentially lead to the overwriting of existing functions and variables without the programmer's knowledge or intent, causing software integrity issues.
Solution: Rather than using wildcard imports, be explicit in your imports or use an alias to avoid conflicts: 'import tkinter as tk'. This will not only maintain the consistency of your code, but also improve security, as it reduces the risk of function or variable overwrites.

Vulnerability: Insecure Use of time, random Libraries
Issue: The use of these libraries could pose security risks if not properly implemented. The time library, especially when used for timing events or calculations, could be targeted for timing attacks. Similarly, the random library is not cryptographically secure, and should not be used for password or token generation.
Solution: Avoid using these libraries for sensitive operations, and instead use libraries intended for these purposes: 'os.urandom()' or 'secrets' for generating secure random values, 'time.perf_counter()' or 'time.process_time()' for timing operations. Always consider the security implications of the libraries and functions you are using.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Verifying if the x value is set to -3.5 when turn_left function is called.
Details:
  TestName: test_turn_left_changes_x_to_negative
  Description: This test is designed to check if the x value is changed to -3.5 when the turn_left method is called, meaning the paddle should move to the left.
Execution:
  Arrange: An object for the Paddle class needs to be created. Also, the x attribute for this object should be set to a value other than -3.5 initially.
  Act: The turn_left method on the created paddle object will be invoked.
  Assert: Check if the x value for the paddle object is now -3.5 after the method call.
Validation:
  This test is critical because it verifies if the paddle is moving in the expected direction, that is to the left when the turn_left function is called. If the x value does not change as expected, it means the paddle is not moving in the correct direction, defeating the purpose of the turn_left function.

Scenario 2: Verifying if the x value remains -3.5 for consecutive calls of turn_left.
Details:
  TestName: test_turn_left_value_unchanged_on_consecutive_calls
  Description: This test will verify that consecutive calls to the turn_left method do not alter the x value further. The x value should remain as -3.5 after multiple calls to turn_left.
Execution:
  Arrange: An object for the Paddle class needs to be created.
  Act: The turn_left method for the paddle object will be called multiple times.
  Assert: Check if the x value for the paddle object remains -3.5 after all the method calls are made.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure the idempotence of the function, i.e., multiple function calls shouldn't change the function's result after the initial application. Therefore, even if the turn_left function is called multiple times, the x value should not go beyond -3.5. If it does, it indicates that the turn_left function is not working as intended. 

Scenario 3: Verifying if the x value changes from any initial value to -3.5 on calling turn_left.
Details:
  TestName: test_turn_left_from_any_initial_value
  Description: This test will ensure that regardless of the initial x value, it will be changed to -3.5 on calling the turn_left method. This is to verify the overriding aspect of the method.
Execution:
  Arrange: An object for the Paddle class needs to be created. The x attribute for this object should be set to different initial values in different instances of the test.
  Act: call the turn_left method on the created paddle object.
  Assert: Check if the x value for the paddle object is now -3.5 after the method call.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the x value correctly changes to -3.5 from any initial value; as such, the paddle can turn left from any position on invoking the turn_left method.
