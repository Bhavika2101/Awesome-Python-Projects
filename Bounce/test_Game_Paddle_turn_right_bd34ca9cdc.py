================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-327: Use of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm
Issue: The current codebase doesn't implement any encryption when handling sensitive data. This can lead to data leaks and unauthorized data access.
Solution: Utilize Python's built-in libraries like 'hashlib' or 'cryptography' to encrypt and secure sensitive data.

Vulnerability: CWE-117: Improper Output Neutralization for Logs
Issue: Print statements or logging can sometimes reveal sensitive information to an unintended audience, especially if they're misconfigured or verbose.
Solution: Ensure proper configuration of log outputs and sanitize data before logging. Be mindful not to log sensitive information.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: Without proper input validation, the code may be susceptible to injection attacks or may behave unexpectedly with special character inputs.
Solution: Always sanitize and validate user inputs. Use library functions like 're' for regular expression checking or use 'escape' function from 'html' library to safeguard against code injection.

Vulnerability: CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')
Issue: The use of 'time.sleep()' in code might lead to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks by making the system unresponsive.
Solution: Use 'time.sleep()' judiciously and only when necessary, as this can potentially hold up the system resources. Monitor the resource usage regularly to identify any resource leaks.

```
Scenario 1: Verify if the method sets self.x to 3.5
Details:
  TestName: test_TurnRightSetsXTo3dot5
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the "turn_right" method sets the value of self.x to 3.5.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Paddle object with an arbitrary x value.
  Act: Call the method "turn_right" of the instance.
  Assert: Check if the x value of the Paddle instance is now set to 3.5.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test and the expected result's connection to the function's specifications and business requirements: As per the method's functionality, the x value should be set to 3.5 when the method "turn_right" is called regardless of its initial value. Validating this is essential to ensure the method works as expected.

Scenario 2: Check whether the method turn_right has no implications on other attributes
Details:
  TestName: test_TurnRightNoChangeInOtherAttributes
  Description: This scenario aims to analyze if the method "turn_right" has no side effects on other attributes of the Paddle object.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Paddle object. Store the initial values of all attributes other than x.
  Act: Invoke the "turn_right" method.
  Assert: Verify that all other attributes of the Paddle object remain unaltered post the method call.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test and the expected result's connection to the function's specifications and business requirements: This is a crucial test because the "turn_right" method should only modify the x attribute. This test will ensure that the method does not unintentionally affect any other attributes of the Paddle instance.

Scenario 3: Confirm that the function call resets x value to 3.5
Details:
  TestName: test_TurnRightResetsXValue
  Description: This test verifies that every call to turn_right sets the x value of the Paddle object anew to 3.5, regardless of the previous value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a Paddle object and set x to a different value other than 3.5.
  Act: Invoke the turn_right method multiple times.
  Assert: Validate that the x value is reset to 3.5 after every call.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test and the expected result's connection to the function's specifications and business requirements: This test verifies that the attribute x is 'hard-reset' to 3.5 irrespective of prior value(s), thus ensuring the expected functionality of the method.
