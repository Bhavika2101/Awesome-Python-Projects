Test Scenario 1: Initial Position
In this scenario, we would check what happens when we call the "turn_right" function for the first time. The expected result should be the setting of the value of 'self.x' to 3.5.

Test Scenario 2: Repeated Execution
Here, we would call the "turn_right" function multiple times and expect the same result with every call, where the value of 'self.x' should be set to 3.5.

Test Scenario 3: Execution after other Operations
In this scenario, we would execute some other operations or function calls which could potentially change the value of 'self.x', followed by the execution of "turn_right". The expected result is for 'self.x' to be set back to 3.5, confirming that the function resets this value irrespective of previous operations.

Test Scenario 4: Execution during an Event
Here, we would trigger the "turn_right" function during an event, such as a key press or mouse click, to validate that the event would be handled as expected and the value of 'self.x' would still be set to 3.5.

Test Scenario 5: Threaded Execution
In this scenario, we would test the "turn_right" function's behavior under multiple threaded calls to ensure the function behaves as intended, that is, setting 'self.x' to 3.5, in thread-safe manner. 

Test Scenario 6: Exception Handling
Although there's no explicit exception handling mentioned in this function, it's useful to test how it behaves when an exception is thrown elsewhere in the program. The expected result should still be setting 'self.x' to 3.5 even if there's an exception thrown during event handling.
