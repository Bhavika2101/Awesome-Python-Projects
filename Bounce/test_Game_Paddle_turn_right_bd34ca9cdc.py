"""
1. Scenario: Check if the paddle's x-coordinate has been updated to 3.5 after calling the turn_right function.
   Test Step: Call the function game.Paddle.turn_right
   Expected Result: The x-coordinate of the paddle should be updated to 3.5.

2. Scenario: Check if the turn_right function works when the paddle's initial position is already at x = 3.5.
   Test Step: Set the paddle's initial x-coordinate as 3.5 and call the function game.Paddle.turn_right
   Expected Result: There should be no changes as the x-coordinate is already at 3.5.

3. Scenario: Check if the turn_right function works independently of the paddle's initial position.
   Test Step: Vary the initial x-coordinate of the paddle and call the function game.Paddle.turn_right
   Expected Result: Regardless of the initial position, after calling the turn_right function, the x-coordinate should always update to 3.5

4. Scenario: Call the turn_right function multiple consecutive times and check if the x-coordinate remains at 3.5 each time.
   Test Step: Call the function game.Paddle.turn_right multiple times.
   Expected Result: Regardless of how many times the function is called, the x-coordinate should always be 3.5

5. Scenario: Check if the turn_right function works correctly in the integration with other functional aspects of the game. For example, moving the paddle, interacting with the ball, etc.
   Test Step: Call the function game.Paddle.turn_right while performing the actions mentioned above.
   Expected Result: The paddle should turn right, and the other functionalities should behave as intended, thus confirming the integration success of the function turn_right. 

6. Scenario: Check the turn_right function working with event emitters
   Test Step: Trigger the function call through event emitter
   Expected Result: The function should behave as expected on the event trigger, moving the paddle to x-coordinate 3.5
