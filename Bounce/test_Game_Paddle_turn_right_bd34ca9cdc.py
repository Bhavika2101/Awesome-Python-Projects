================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: No input validation or sanitization (CWE-20)
Issue: Lack of input validation could possibly allow malicious or unintended behavior, such as executing unauthorized commands.
Solution: Add input validation checks to ensure that only valid and accepted inputs are provided.

Vulnerability: Unrestricted use of 'import' (CWE-1173)
Issue: The open-ended structure of the import statements could potentially allow for the importation and usage of unintended modules containing vulnerabilities or malicious code.
Solution: Use package-specific imports explicitly, instead of relying on wildcard (*) imports to minimize potential security issues.

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) or insecure object references (CWE-639)
Issue: Unrestricted external control of critical state/data could potentially have unwarranted side effects, such as data corruption or crashes.
Solution: Ensure object references are not directly accessible from outside the intended object or scope.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for normal functionality of `turn_right` method.
```
Details:
  TestName: test_turn_right_functionality
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the `turn_right` method correctly updates the `x` attribute of the `Paddle` instance to 3.5 on being invoked, irrespective of the event argument passed.
Execution:
  Arrange: A `Paddle` instance will be set up. The initial value of the `x` attribute can be arbitrary.
  Act: The `turn_right` method will be invoked on the paddle instance, passing in any arbitrary event.
  Assert: The test will assert that the `x` attribute of the `Paddle` instance is now 3.5.
Validation:
  The importance of this test lies in ensuring the basic functionality of the `turn_right` method. This value represents the new position of the paddle when it turns right in the game - key to allow game progression and player interaction.
  
Scenario 2: Test that `turn_right` method overwrites existing value of `x`.
```
Details:
  TestName: test_turn_right_overwrites
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the `turn_right` method overwrites any pre-existing value of the `x` attribute of the `Paddle` instance.
Execution:
  Arrange: A `Paddle` instance will be set up, and the `x` attribute will be set to any value other than 3.5. 
  Act: The `turn_right` method will be invoked on the paddle instance.
  Assert: The test will assert that the value of the `x` attribute is now 3.5, irrespective of its earlier value.
Validation:
  The importance of this test is to ensure that the `turn_right` method correctly represents the state of the `Paddle` after the turn right action has been executed. Even if the paddle has been previously moved or positioned in other places (i.e., the `x` attribute has a different value), turning right should always result in the paddle being at the same, expected location.
  
Scenario 3: Test that `turn_right` method is not affected by sequence of events.
```
Details:
  TestName: test_turn_right_sequence_independence
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the `turn_right` method sets the `Paddle` instance's `x` attribute to 3.5, irrespective of the sequence of `Events` that are passed to it.
Execution:
  Arrange: Several `Event` instances will be created and applied on a `Paddle` instance in various sequences.
  Act: The `turn_right` method will be invoked on the `Paddle` instance, and for each sequence, the final event will always be a right turn event. 
  Assert: The test will assert that, regardless of the sequence of events, the `x` attribute's final value is always 3.5 after the right turn event.
Validation:
  This test validates that the `turn_right` method correctly implements the act of turning right, independent from the events that happened before. This is crucial for player interaction and game progression.
