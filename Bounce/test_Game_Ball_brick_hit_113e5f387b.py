"""
Scenario 1: No Brick Hit
- Given a ball position that doesn't overlap with any brick.
- When brick_hit is called, 
- Then the function should return False.
- Verify that the score and hit count do not increase.

Scenario 2: Single Brick Hit
- Given a ball position that overlaps with exactly one brick.
- When brick_hit is called,
- Then the function should return True.
- Verify that the score and the hit count increase by 1.
- Verify that the brick hit by the ball is removed from the canvas.

Scenario 3: Multiple Brick Hit
- Given a ball position that overlaps with more than one brick.
- When brick_hit is called,
- Then the function should return True after hitting the first brick encountered.
- Verify that the score and the hit count increase by 1.
- Verify that only the first brick hit by the ball is removed from the canvas.
- Ensure the function doesn't affect other overlapping bricks.

Scenario 4: Brick Hit with Exception During Processing
- Given a ball position that overlaps with a brick but there's an exception during the hit processing (deleting the brick, for example).
- When brick_hit is called, 
- Then the function should safely continue to the next brick without breaking the program (due to the try & except block)
- Verify that the score and hit count do not increase.

Scenario 5: Score Update 
- Given a ball position that overlaps with a brick.
- When brick_hit is called,
- Then the function should successfully play the bell sound.
- Verify that the score text is accurately updated with the incremented hit count.

Scenario 6: Canvas Element Deletion
- Given a ball position that overlaps with a brick.
- When brick_hit is called, 
- Then the function should successfully delete the brick from the canvas.
- Verify that the deleted brick is no longer part of the canvas elements.
