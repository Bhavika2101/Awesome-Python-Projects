"""
1. Scenario : Testing whether the ball hits a brick
    - Given a list of bricks and their positions are defined
    - When the ball coordinates align with the coordinates of a brick
    - Then the function should return True, indicating a successful hit

2. Scenario : Testing when the ball does not hit any bricks
    - Given a list of bricks and their positions are defined
    - When the ball coordinates do not match any brick's coordinates
    - Then the function should return False, indicating no hit

3. Scenario : Testing the score increment
    - Given a list of bricks and their positions are defined 
    - When the ball hits a brick and the hit counter increments
    - Then the displayed score should also increment accordingly

4. Scenario : Testing for proper deletion of a hit brick
    - Given a list of bricks and their positions are defined
    - When a brick is hit by the ball
    - Then the brick should be deleted from the canvas

5. Scenario : Testing the canvas.bell() function 
    - Given a list of bricks and their positions are defined
    - When a brick is hit by the ball
    - Then a bell sound should be played

6. Scenario : Testing exception handling
    - Given a list of bricks and their positions are defined
    - When an error occurs within the `try` block
    - Then the `except` block should be entered and the function should continue with the next brick

7. Scenario : Testing the function with an empty bricks list
    - Given an empty list of bricks
    - When the ball is played 
    - Then the function should return False indicating no brick has been hit

8. Scenario : Testing the function with multiple hit bricks in one call
    - Given a list of bricks and their positions are defined
    - When the ball hits multiple bricks at once
    - Then each hit should increment the score and the bricks should be deleted
