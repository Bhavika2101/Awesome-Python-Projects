"""
1. Scenario: Test when "pos" input does not collide with any bricks
    - Aim: To confirm the function returns False when there's no collision with bricks.
    - Steps: Call the function brick_hit with "pos" such that none of the bricks are within its range.
    - Expected outcome: The function should return False.
    
2. Scenario: Test when "pos" input collides with one brick 
    - Aim: To confirm the function behaves as expected when the "pos" collides with a brick i.e., increment hit count, update score, delete affected brick and return True.
    - Steps: Call the function brick_hit with "pos" such that it collides with exactly one brick.
    - Expected outcome: The function should delete the colliding brick, increment the hit count by one, update the score, and return True.

3. Scenario: Test when "pos" input collides with multiple bricks
    - Aim: To ensure the function behaves correctly even when "pos" collides with more than one brick. It should only consider the first collision.
    - Steps: Call the function brick_hit with "pos" such that it collides with more than one brick.
    - Expected outcome: Only the first collision should be considered, the hit count should be incremented by one, the score updated and the specific brick should be deleted. The function should return True.

4. Scenario: Test when brick_hit function is invoked immediately after a brick is deleted 
    - Aim: To confirm the function handles the deletion of bricks correctly and doesn't throw any errors when encountering pre-deleted bricks.
    - Steps: Call the function brick_hit immediately after a brick has been deleted.
    - Expected outcome: The function should continue to operate seamlessly and accurately.

5. Scenario: Test for Exception handling 
    - Aim: To ensure the function properly handles any exceptions that might arise during its runtime.
    - Steps: Manipulate the game state such that it would end up causing an exception when brick_hit is called.
    - Expected outcome: The function should handle the exception gracefully, it should not stop execution and rather continue to the next operation.

6. Scenario: Test when the function is invoked multiple successive times 
    - Aim: To confirm that the function correctly keeps track of the score and the number of hits.
    - Steps: Call the function brick_hit multiple times in succession, with pos colliding with bricks.
    - Expected outcome: The number of hits and score on the canvas should increase correctly and the function should return True as many times as 'pos' collides with the bricks.
