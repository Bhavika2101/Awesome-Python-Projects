"""
1. One Ball and Single Brick Scenario: Assuming the ball hits exactly one brick, the test scenario should validate if the method deletes the brick and increments the score.

2. Multiple Ball and Bricks Scenario: If there are multiple balls involved and if they hit multiple bricks at once, the method should validate that each brick hit is acknowledged and the score incremented accordingly.

3. Ball Misses Brick Scenario: Test a scenario where the ball does not hit any brick. The method should return False and not increment the score.

4. Zero Brick Scenario: Test a case where there are no bricks present. The method should return False and not increment the score.

5. Game Over Scenario: Test a scenario where all bricks are hit and deleted. The method should return True only when a brick is hit and deleted. After all bricks are hit, the method should always return False until new bricks are added.

6. Brick Out of Canvas Scenario: Test a scenario where the brick is positioned outside the canvas i.e., negative co-ordinates or beyond the canvas limits. The method should handle this case gracefully, and not affect the score.

7. Ball Edge Hits Brick Scenario: If a ball hits on edge of the brick, the method should still delete the brick and increment the score.

8. Ball Inside Brick Scenario: In this less likely scenario, where a ball is spawned inside a brick position, the method should still be able to handle this and increment the hit score while deleting the respective brick. 

9. Concurrent Hit Scenario: Test a scenario where two balls hit the same brick almost simultaneously. The method should handle this concurrent hit case properly, ensuring accurate score increment without any errors.
