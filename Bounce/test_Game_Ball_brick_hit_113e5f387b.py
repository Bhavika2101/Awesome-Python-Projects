"""
1. Scenario: Ball hits a brick on the canvas
   - Given a ball position that overlaps with a brick's coordinates
   - When the function 'brick_hit' is called
   - Then the function should play a bell sound, increment the hit score, display the updated score, delete the brick from the canvas and return True

2. Scenario: Ball doesn't hit any brick on the canvas
   - Given a ball position that doesn't overlap with any brick's coordinates
   - When the function 'brick_hit' is called
   - Then the function should not make any changes to the score, nor remove any bricks from the canvas and return False

3. Scenario: Ball hits multiple bricks on the canvas
   - Given a ball position that overlaps with multiple bricks' coordinates
   - When the function 'brick_hit' is called
   - Then the function should play a bell sound, increment the hit score by the number of bricks hit, display the updated score, delete the hit bricks from the canvas, and return True

4. Scenario: Exception Handling
   - If an unexpected error occurs while checking brick positions
   - The function should handle the error gracefully without stopping the game and continue to the next brick

5. Scenario: Ball hits a brick on the border of the canvas
   - Given a ball position that barely overlaps with a brick's coordinates on the border
   - When the function 'brick_hit' is called
   - Then the function should still recognize the hit, play a bell sound, increment the hit score, display the updated score, delete the brick from the canvas and return True

6. Scenario: Ball hits the brick after hitting the sideways of the canvas
   - Given a ball position that hits the brick after reflecting from the sideways of the canvas
   - When the function 'brick_hit' is called
   - Then the function should still recognize the hit, play a bell sound, increment the hit score, display the updated score, delete the brick from the canvas and return True.
