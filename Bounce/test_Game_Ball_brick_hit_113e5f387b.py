"""
Scenario 1: Ball hits a brick
- Given the ball's current position (pos) is directly over a brick. 
- When the ball's position (pos) is passed on to the function "brick_hit".
- Then it should play a sound ("canvas.bell()"), increase the hit score ("self.hit += 1"), update the score display ("self.score.configure()"), delete the brick ("self.canvas.delete()"), and return "True". 

Scenario 2: Ball doesn't hit any brick
- Given the ball's current position (pos) is such that it does not collide with any brick. 
- When the ball's position (pos) is passed on to the function "brick_hit".
- Then the function should return "False" without making any changes to the game score or the display.

Scenario 3: Multiple bricks hit
- Given the ball's current position (pos) falls between multiple bricks.
- When the ball's position (pos) is passed to the function "brick_hit".
- Then the function should only consider the first brick for reporting the hit and scoring and ignore the rest.

Scenario 4: The ball's position data mismatches with the bricks data
- Given the ball's current position (pos) data contains unusual or unexpected elements due to some error or algorithmic flaw.
- When the ball's position (pos) is passed to the function "brick_hit".
- Then the function should be able to handle the error gracefully and continue the execution by skipping the current brick without letting the error affect the game execution.

Scenario 5: An empty list of bricks
- Given that the list 'bricks' is empty i.e., there is no brick left on the field.
- When the function 'brick_hit' is called with the position 'pos' of the ball.
- Then the function should return 'False' immediately as there are no bricks to collide with.
