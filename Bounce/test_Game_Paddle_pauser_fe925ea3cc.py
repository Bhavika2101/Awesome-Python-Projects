"""
1. Test Scenario: Pause Counter Increment 
   Description: Test if the pause counter increments every time the 'pauser' function is called. The pause count should increase by 1 each time this function is called until it reaches the upper limit, which is 2 in this case.

2. Test Scenario: Counter Reset to Zero After Reaching Upper Limit 
   Description: Validate that the pause counter gets reset to zero after it reaches 2. Upon the second invocation of 'pauser', the value of self.pausec should be 0. 

3. Test Scenario: Pause Counter Not Exceeding Upper Limit 
   Description: Confirm if the pause counter doesn't exceed 2. On all calls to 'pauser' after the pause counter has been reset to zero, it should still never exceed 2.

4. Test Scenario: Counter Behavior on Simultaneous Pauser Invocations
   Description: Checks the behavior of the pause counter when the 'pauser' function is invoked simultaneously from different threads. The pauser() function is supposed to be thread-safe, therefore we need to confirm that the behavior of the pause counter is as expected in such scenarios.

5. Test Scenario: Counter Persistence After Function Call 
   Description: Validate if the value of self.pausec holds after the 'pauser' function has been called and completed its execution. The function is stateful, it should not lose the current state of the pause counter after it exits.

6. Test Scenario: Correct Initialization 
   Description: Validate that the initial value of self.pausec is 0 before the 'pauser' function is invoked for the first time.

7. Test Scenario: Check for Exception Handling
   Description: Validate the 'pauser' function for exception handling. This scenario would be applicable if the 'pauser' function gets updated in the future with more complexity that could raise exceptions. Even though the current implementation is too simple to raise an exception, it's always good to stay prepared for the future.
